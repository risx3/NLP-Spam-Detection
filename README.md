# Spam-Detection
Spam detection is a common application of classification in machine learning. It involves predicting whether an email message is spam or not based on its contents.

The spam detection algorithm is trained on a dataset of labeled emails, where each email is labeled as either spam or not spam (also known as ham). The algorithm uses this dataset to learn the relationship between the features of the email, such as the subject, the sender, and the content, and the label.

Once the algorithm is trained, it can be used to predict the label of new email messages. The algorithm extracts the relevant features from the email message and uses the classification model to predict whether the email is spam or not.

There are several classification algorithms that can be used for spam detection, including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines. Naive Bayes is a popular choice for spam detection because of its simplicity and effectiveness.

To evaluate the performance of a spam detection algorithm, metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score can be used. These metrics measure the algorithm's ability to correctly identify spam emails and avoid false positives (i.e., marking a non-spam email as spam).
